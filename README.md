random-art
==========

Not really random, random-art generator in python. How flipping random is random?

As originally stated from the original project:

>Python code for the post ["Random (Psychedelic) Art, and a Pinch of Python"](http://jeremykun.com/2012/01/01/random-psychedelic-art/)

I liked this idea as a concept for making bizarro cluts and have since started
to expand it. etc.

I suppose it's "psychedelic" but it's not--maybe I need to be on more drugs or
a hippy.
