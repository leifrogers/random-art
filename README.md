random-art
==========

Not really random, random-art generator in python.

As originally stated from the, er, original:

>Python code for the post ["Random (Psychedelic) Art, and a Pinch of Python"](http://jeremykun.com/2012/01/01/random-psychedelic-art/)

I liked this idea as a concept for making bizarro cluts and have since started to expand it. etc.

nothing special.
